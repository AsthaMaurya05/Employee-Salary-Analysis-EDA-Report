💼 Employee Salary Data Analysis using Python 🧮📊
I recently worked on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focusing on employee salary trends in a public sector organization for the year 2024. The goal was to extract meaningful insights regarding pay distribution, department/division-based compensation, and salary component relationships using Python.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing salary values

Converted salary columns to numeric types

Created a new column for Total Pay (Base + Overtime + Longevity Pay)

📈 Descriptive Statistics

Used .info(), .describe(), and .isnull() to explore the dataset

Investigated salary trends and statistical distributions

📊 Visualizations:
Count Plot showing employee distribution by Gender

Histogram + KDE of Base Salary to understand distribution shape

Box Plot to detect outliers in base pay

Heatmap visualizing correlation between salary components

Bar Charts for:

Top 10 Divisions by Average Base Salary

Top 5 Departments by Average Total Pay

Scatter Plot showing relationship between Base Salary and Overtime Pay

💡 Insights:
Most employees earn mid-to-high range base salaries

Outliers indicate executive or leadership-level roles

Base Salary has a strong impact on Total Pay

Certain divisions and departments are compensated significantly more than others

No strong correlation between base salary and overtime pay for most employees

📂 Tools Used:
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

This project sharpened my skills in data visualization, pattern detection, and data-driven storytelling — critical capabilities for any role in Data Science or HR Analytics.
